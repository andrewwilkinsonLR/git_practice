# Using Organizations to Create a Sales Network

A B2B business' real world sales network hierarchy can be mirrored in Liferay Commerce running on DXP using the Organizations feature. In Commerce and DXP, an Organization is a hierarchical arrangement of Users that can model real-world organizational hierarchies – such as a sales network – and that enables distributed and simplified management of Users, Roles, Permissions and Accounts, for enhanced security and collaboration.

(Note A Role is a collection of permissions that can be granted to a User. A Permission is any specific assignable action a User may take, such as view a menu, account or widget, assign Roles, add Users, etc. For more on Roles and Permissions, see _____.) 

When Organizations are used along with assigning permissions to Organization Roles, users simply need to be assigned to an organization to inherit the correct permissions that were defined for it. For example, a B2B company can give everyone in their sales network access to the right account information through their organizational membership.

Additionally, when someone transfers to another part of the organization, simply move the user to another organization in Liferay Commerce and there's no need to hassle with updating the user's individual roles and permissions. For example, a B2B company can quickly and easily add or remove access to account information when there are sales network personnel changes, by simply changing the user's organizational membership.

## Setup Step 1 Mirror Real-World Sales Network Organizational Hierarchies

In Liferay Commerce, B2B businesses can use Organizations to mirror their real world organizational structure in their digital commerce environment.

In this way, a business can organize its sales team and its accounts in Liferay Commerce to exactly match the real world. As a result, it will be easy for every salesperson (and other team members) to see the company's structure mapped to its digital space. This common sense clarity is a good first step.

## Setup Step 2 Define Sales Network Account Access With Roles and Permissions

In Liferay Commerce, B2B businesses can use Organization-level roles and permissions to carefully define what each role can and can't do, and then those roles can be assigned to every salesperson.

(screenshot Show Organizational Roles - maybe three roles Owner, Admin, Salesperson)

Some of the different permissions that can be assigned to an Organization member include the ability to view different regions (suborganizations), the ability to assign roles, and the ability to view account data, whether or not they receive notifications, view order history, edit orders, etc.

(screenshot Show Organizational Permissions - maybe four permissions view account, view order history, edit orders, place orders)

In this way, a business can give each salesperson access to the proper account information with proper allowable actions. This clarity is empowering for each salesperson, and it also facilitates collaboration between salespersons within the same organization or who otherwise have mutual access to an account.

## Long-Term Operation Manage Sales Networks With Organizational Membership

In Liferay Commerce, once Organizations, Roles and Permissions are set up and assigned, administrators in a B2B business are ready for any personnel changes or structural reorganization that arise.

For example, if a salesperson's status changes (hired, promoted, changes regions, leaves the company, etc.), his role and permissions can easily be changed by an administrator indirectly by simply moving his organizational membership, as opposed to having to manage each individual permission assigned to that person.

## Using Organizations Clear Organization, Proper Access, Easy Administration

Once a B2B business takes these steps with Liferay Commerce, it has clear organization, proper access, and easy administration. The business mirrors its real-world organizational hierarchy in its digital environment, it gives access to the right people with the right information, and it has made it quicker and easier to administer access over time.
